# Airframe Model for Linearization and Control Design

Use this model of the de Havilland Beaver Airframe to follow along with "Trim, Linearization, and Control Design for an Aircraft" and learn about this linearization and control design workflow. The airframe takes in elevator, aileron, rudder, and throttle as inputs and outputs angles, angular rates, and position in the body coordinate frame.


## Setup 
To Run:
1. open "dehavillandControl.slx"
2. select "run" from the toolstrip
